The file 'recognizer.py' can be run as is (it will run on an example sentence) or in interactive
mode. Please note that in its current state the Lexicon is very small and does not support practically
any variation in input. This essentially means that for now it is best to run just the demo version
of the file.

All the remaining files at this stage are purely demos and cannot be run in interactive mode

The file 'mg1.py' is my first take on coding minimalism and runs through one of Stabler's examples
from his 1995 paper.

'chartmg.py' and 'chartmg2.py' are chart parser implementations of an MG. Run these if you like to
see looots of print statements.

I am also writing a paper for this project, comparing Stabler's MG parser to the Minimalist Parser
posited by Amy Weinberg.
